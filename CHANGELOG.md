## [1.3.0] - 04/06/2026

### Fixed
- `.github/workflows/build-images.yml` — GHCR requires image tags to be fully lowercase. Removed static `IMAGE_PREFIX` env var (which preserved the mixed-case org name `Krafty-Sprouts-Media-LLC`) and replaced with a `Set lowercase image prefix` step that uses `tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'` to produce `ghcr.io/krafty-sprouts-media-llc/dokploy-wp` at runtime before any build steps execute.

## [1.2.0] - 04/06/2026

### Fixed
- `README.md` — Corrected template Base URL and manual compose URL from `itsmereal/dokploy-wp` to `Krafty-Sprouts-Media-LLC/WPDokploystack`.
- `blueprints/wordpress-redis-stack/docker-compose.yml` — Updated all three Docker image references (`nginx`, `wordpress`, `plugin-installer`) from `ghcr.io/itsmereal/...` to `ghcr.io/krafty-sprouts-media-llc/...` so the one-click template pulls from the org's own GHCR registry.

## [1.1.0] - 04/06/2026

### Added
- `docs/hosting-guide.md` — Comprehensive hosting guide adapted from the original article by Al-Mamun Talukder at [itsmereal.com](https://itsmereal.com/easily-host-wordpress-sites-using-dokploy-with-redis-and-nginx/), with full attribution and expanded reference tables.

### Changed
- `meta.json` — Updated `github` and `docs` links to point to the new **Krafty-Sprouts-Media-LLC/WPDokploystack** repository. Added `upstream` link referencing the original `itsmereal/dokploy-wp` source for attribution.
- Bumped version from `1.0.0` to `1.1.0`.
