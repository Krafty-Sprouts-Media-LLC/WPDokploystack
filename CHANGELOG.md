## [1.7.1] - 04/06/2026

### Added
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — Automated GitHub Release creation on `v*.*.*` tag push. Extracts the relevant CHANGELOG.md section as the release body. Future version tags will automatically appear under GitHub Releases with formatted notes.

### Notes
- Retroactive tags `v1.1.0` through `v1.7.0` are available under the **Tags** tab on GitHub. To promote them to full Releases with notes, open each tag on GitHub and click **Create release from tag** — the release workflow only applies to future tag pushes.

## [1.7.0] - 04/06/2026

### Added
- `wordpress/docker-entrypoint-custom.sh` — **Layer 1: wp-config.php auto-fix.** On every container start, detects if `DB_HOST` in wp-config.php differs from the `WORDPRESS_DB_HOST` environment variable (indicating a migration tool has overwritten it). If mismatch is found, uses `wp config set` to surgically correct only: `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`, `WP_REDIS_HOST`, `WP_REDIS_PORT`, `WP_CACHE`. All other custom constants (`DISABLE_WP_CRON`, auth keys, table prefix, `WP_DEBUG`, etc.) are completely untouched.
- `wordpress/ksm-migration-fixer.php` — **Layer 2: Must-use plugin.** Deployed to `wp-content/mu-plugins/` by the entrypoint on every container start. Fires only when `ksm-migration-pending.txt` marker file exists. Handles: siteurl/home URL correction, rewrite rule flush, Redis cache flush, Migrate Guru artefact removal (`migrategurupull.php`, `mg_storage`), Migrate Guru destination deactivation, Redis Object Cache re-activation. Writes audit log to `wp-content/ksm-migration-fixer.log`. Removes marker after running so cleanup fires only once.
- `wordpress/Dockerfile` — Added `COPY ksm-migration-fixer.php /usr/local/lib/ksm/` step to bundle the mu-plugin inside the image (outside `wp-content`) so it cannot be overwritten by migration tools.

## [1.6.0] - 04/06/2026

### Added
- `docs/hosting-guide.md` — New **Updating the Stack** section replacing the brief settings-only note. Covers: version change categories (image vs compose vs docs), how `:latest` image pulls work on Redeploy, how compose changes reach Option A vs Option B deployments, data volume persistence guarantee, how to handle new required vs defaulted environment variables.

---

## [1.5.0] - 04/06/2026

### Added
- `docs/hosting-guide.md` — **Alternative Migration Method** section covering Migrate Guru plugin-based migration, including SFTP integration steps and note on usefulness for shared hosting sources.
- `docs/hosting-guide.md` — **Future Enhancements** section documenting MilliCache full-page Redis caching as a planned enhancement, including comparison table vs. current Redis Object Cache, and a step-by-step outline of what integration would require (Nginx config merge, image rebuild, redeploy).

---

## [1.4.0] - 04/06/2026

### Added
- `docs/hosting-guide.md` — Major expansion with four new sections:
  - **MariaDB & phpMyAdmin Full Walkthrough** — clarifies that MariaDB is bundled in the stack (not a separate install), shows internal Docker networking diagram, phpMyAdmin access setup, common tasks, and root access.
  - **How Services Are Connected** — ASCII diagram showing internal Docker network topology, explains container DNS resolution (`db`, `redis`), and why no manual connection configuration is needed.
  - **Renaming the Stack in Dokploy** — explains what is safe to rename, what renaming does not affect, and safe rename procedure with volume warning.
  - **Migrating WordPress from Local Disk** — full 8-step migration guide covering database export/import, file upload, `search-replace` for domain change, permission fix, and Redis re-activation.

## [1.3.0] - 04/06/2026

### Fixed
- `.github/workflows/build-images.yml` — GHCR requires image tags to be fully lowercase. Removed static `IMAGE_PREFIX` env var (which preserved the mixed-case org name `Krafty-Sprouts-Media-LLC`) and replaced with a `Set lowercase image prefix` step that uses `tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'` to produce `ghcr.io/krafty-sprouts-media-llc/dokploy-wp` at runtime before any build steps execute.

---

## [1.2.0] - 04/06/2026

### Fixed
- `README.md` — Corrected template Base URL and manual compose URL from `itsmereal/dokploy-wp` to `Krafty-Sprouts-Media-LLC/WPDokploystack`.
- `blueprints/wordpress-redis-stack/docker-compose.yml` — Updated all three Docker image references (`nginx`, `wordpress`, `plugin-installer`) from `ghcr.io/itsmereal/...` to `ghcr.io/krafty-sprouts-media-llc/...` so the one-click template pulls from the org's own GHCR registry.

---

## [1.1.0] - 04/06/2026

### Added
- `docs/hosting-guide.md` — Comprehensive hosting guide adapted from the original article by Al-Mamun Talukder at [itsmereal.com](https://itsmereal.com/easily-host-wordpress-sites-using-dokploy-with-redis-and-nginx/), with full attribution and expanded reference tables.

### Changed
- `meta.json` — Updated `github` and `docs` links to point to the new **Krafty-Sprouts-Media-LLC/WPDokploystack** repository. Added `upstream` link referencing the original `itsmereal/dokploy-wp` source for attribution.
- Bumped version from `1.0.0` to `1.1.0`.
